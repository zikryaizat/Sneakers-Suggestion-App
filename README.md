# Sneakers-Suggestion-App

**About**
The project entails the development of a web application aimed at offering personalized sneaker recommendations based on user preferences. Leveraging advanced natural language processing and image generation models, the app provides detailed insights into various sneaker attributes, including brands, colors, prices, and materials. It consists of two pages and employs Streamlit, a Python library known for creating intuitive web applications for machine learning and data science projects.

**Implementation Details**
Python serves as the primary programming language for developing the application. Streamlit facilitates the deployment process, ensuring seamless user interaction. The project harnesses the capabilities of three Language Learning Models (LLMs): GPT-3.5 Turbo for text-to-text interactions, Gemini-Pro for text-to-text processing, and DALL-E-2 for text-to-image generation. The utilization of these models enriches the user experience by enabling comprehensive textual and visual exploration of sneakers.

**Sneaker Recommendation Algorithm**
The app employs an intelligent recommendation algorithm to suggest sneakers based on user's selection of preferences across three price ranges: low, medium, and high. Each price range is represented in a separate table, offering users a curated selection of sneakers based on their budgetary considerations. Furthermore, users have the option to input the name of a specific sneaker via a text box to obtain detailed information about that particular model.

**Future Improvements**
- More input options for selectbar.
- Add text box area for users to describe the sneakers that they want. So users can choose whether to just select the options or write it themselves.
- Generate real images of the sneakers.
- Obtain real time data for prices of the sneakers.
