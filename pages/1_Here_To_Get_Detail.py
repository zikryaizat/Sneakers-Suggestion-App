    Details:
    The Yeezy Boost 350 V2 is a popular sneaker model created in collaboration between Adidas and Kanye West, the American rapper, singer, and fashion designer.\n
    * Brand: Adidas (collaboration with Kanye West)\n
    * Release Year: The Yeezy Boost 350 V2 was first released in September 2016.\n
    * Material: The Yeezy Boost 350 V2 is primarily made from re-engineered Primeknit with additional elements like a monofilament side stripe, reflective threads, and a Boost midsole.\n
    * Available Colors: There have been numerous colorways released since its initial launch. Some of the most popular ones include "Zebra," "Beluga," "Bred," "Cream White," "Sesame," "Static," "Butter," "Black Static," "Yeezreel," "Clay," "Lundmark," "Yecheil," and many more. New colorways are periodically released, so the available options may vary over time.\n
    * Size Range: The Yeezy Boost 350 V2 is typically available in a wide range of sizes, catering to both men and women. Sizes typically range from US 4 to US 16 for men and US 5 to US 12 for women.\n
    * Collaborations: While the Yeezy Boost 350 V2 is primarily a collaboration between Adidas and Kanye West, there have been some limited edition releases that involved collaborations with other brands or artists. For example, there have been collaborations with brands like BAPE and collaborations with artists like Pharrell Williams. However, these collaborations are less common compared to the general releases.\n
    * Average Price: The retail price for a pair of Yeezy Boost 350 V2 sneakers varies depending on the specific colorway and any special editions or collaborations. Retail prices typically range from around $220 to $250 USD. However, due to their popularity and limited availability, resale prices for certain colorways can be significantly higher, sometimes reaching hundreds or even thousands of dollars above retail.\n
